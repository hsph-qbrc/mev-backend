Install [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

Set up an AWS profile (use `us-east-2` region):
```shell
aws configure --profile webmev
export AWS_PROFILE=webmev
```
If this is the first time deploying in your AWS account, [see the initial setup first](#init_setup).

Configure Terraform:
```shell
cd deployment-aws/terraform
terraform init
```
Create a new Terraform workspace, for example `dev`:
```shell
terraform workspace new dev
```
Note:
* workspace name will be used for:
  * naming AWS resources and Route53 records
  * Terraform state S3 object prefix
  * log bucket key prefix
* use workspace name `prod` for production deployments

Configure the site using `terraform.tfvars` file, for example:
```terraform
admin_email_csv = "admin@example.org"
backend_domain = "dev-mev-api.tm4.org"
django_superuser_email = "admin@example.org"
from_email = "WebMEV <noreply@mail.webmev.tm4.org>"
frontend_domain = "dev-mev.tm4.org"
ssh_key_pair_name = "dev-webmev"
storage_location = "local"
```

Create a CNAME record with the `tm4.org` domain registrar or DNS provider, for example:
```
dev-mev-api.tm4.org    CNAME    dev-mev-api.aws.tm4.org
```
where `dev` is your Terraform workspace name

Deploy the site:
```shell
terraform apply
```
Delete the site:
```shell
terraform destroy
```

## Initial setup
The following steps need to be done only once to bootstrap the project in your AWS account.

Create a private S3 bucket named `webmev-terraform` to store Terraform state and secrets:
```shell
aws s3 mb s3://webmev-terraform --region us-east-2
aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket webmev-terraform --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=Project,Value=WebMEV}]'
```
(note that if you name the bucket as something else, you will need to modify the s3 backend in `main.tf`-- edit accordingly)

[Create an HTTPS certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html) for `*.tm4.org` in Certificate Manager

[Create a public Route53 hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreatingHostedZone.html) `aws.tm4.org`

[Create a service-linked role for AWS Batch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html#create-slr)

## Connecting to the EC2 instances

For debugging or other reasons, you may need to connect to the API server or Cromwell EC2 instances. To track/audit connections to these servers and avoid managing SSH keys, we use AWS Systems Manager (SSM).

There are multiple ways to connect to the instance, but below we describe initiating a session using your local machine using the AWS cli (which we assume is installed).

To initiate a session/connection from your local machine, you need to [install the SSM plugin.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)

Once that is installed, you can start a session using the following:

```shell
aws ssm start-session --target <INSTANCE_ID>
```
which will return a session ID in addition to connecting to your instance.

Note that issuing `exit` in your session will terminate the connection, but you can also close it using `aws ssm terminate-session --session-id <SESSION_ID>`.

Also note that by default, SSM will connect using Bourne shell (sh). [You can modify this preference usign the AWS cli or via console](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ssm-session-manager-change-shell/).

## Notes on redeployment

Note the following assumptions, based on the terraform plan:
- Terraform will *not* destroy the main storage and Cromwell buckets if they have any objects. Hence, `terraform destroy` will preserve the bucket-based files. This is the default behavior unless `force_destroy=true` in `terraform/storage.tf`.
- As part of destroy, terraform creates a snapshot of the EBS volume holding the data (typically mounted at `/data`).
- As part of destroy, terraform creates a snapshot the database.

If you wish to redeploy, we have the option of restoring state via `data_volume_snapshot_id` (for using a snapshot as our EBS "data volume") and `database_snapshot`. If those are not specified in your `tfvars`, they default to `null`, which means Terraform will create a new data volume and/or RDS instance.

## Incorporating Globus

If you wish to incorporate Globus into WebMeV, see the [Globus setup instructions](./globus_setup.md)
