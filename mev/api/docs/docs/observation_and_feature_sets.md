### `ObservationSet` and `FeatureSet`

We can compose unique sets of `Observation` and `Feature` instances into `ObservationSet` and `FeatureSet` instances, respectively. These data structures can be used as a way to subset/filter samples/observations or to provide groups of samples to analyses (such as when comparing two groups for a differential expression analysis).
