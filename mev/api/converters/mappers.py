    A base class for inputs which serve as a proxy for the true inputs.

    An example is when we need multiple genome-specific files (such as for 
    a BWA alignment) and the user simply needs to dictate which genome to use.
    Then, the mapper implementation will take that input (e.g. a string coming from
    an OptionString input type) and return back the relevant info (paths to 
    index files).

    Importantly, the returned values are what populate the 'final' inputs that are used
    to execute the analysis. So, if we are talking about a Cromwell-based job, then those
    files need to be located in a cloud-based bucket already.
