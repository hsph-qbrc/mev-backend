###################### Start cloud env related parameters ###############################

# of remote job runner services, etc.

# The cloud platform determines which classes are used to hook up to

# django looks for this variable upon startup. For local dev, it only has to be
# one of the valid values

# not enable remote job runs.
# For local dev, can leave as-is

###################### Storage-related parameters ######################################

# the storage backend dictates where the "absolute" source of the files is. Of course,
# to perform many operations we need to move files back and forth between local and
# cloud storage. However, only one location serves as the "ground truth", and this is
# the path that is saved in the database (in the Resource table).
# Note that if you are requesting to use remote job runners (ENABLE_REMOTE_JOB_RUNNERS is truthy)
# then you are REQUIRED to use bucket storage. You can only use local storage if all
# your job runners are local.
# Options include "local" and "remote"
# For local dev where you are using this backend API as a "mock data" server, then
# set this to local. 
STORAGE_LOCATION=local


# the path to a JSON file containing the credentials to authenticate with the Google storage API.
# The startup script will perform the authentication and place the credentials into this file.
# Note that this authentication can ONLY happen if we are on GCP and can use the VMs service
# account.
# For local dev that does not interact with a google bucket, that authentication doesn't
# happen and we simply "touch" this file.
STORAGE_CREDENTIALS="/vagrant/storage_credentials.json"

# If using local storage for all files (not recommended since sequencing files
# could consume large amount of disk space), set the following:
# This directory is relative to the django BASE_DIR
LOCAL_STORAGE_DIRNAME=user_resources

# A bucket where MEV user's files will be stored (if using bucket storage). This
# is independent of any buckets used as a storage location for remote job runners, etc.
# DO NOT inlude the prefix, e.g. "gs://" or "s3://".
# THIS BUCKET MUST ALREADY EXIST. 
# Note that for local dev, you can leave this blank
STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=""

# The maximum size (in bytes) to allow "direct" downloads from the API.
# If the file exceeds this, we ask the user to download in another way. 
# Most files are small and this will be fine. However, we don't want users
# trying to download BAM or other large files. They can do that with other methods,
# like via Dropbox.
# For local dev, this is ignored
MAX_DOWNLOAD_SIZE_BYTES=5.12e8

# For signing download URLs we need a credentials file. To create that, we need a
# service account with appropriate privileges. This variable is the full name of that
# service account file (e.g. <id>@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
# For local dev, can simply leave this dummy, since we are not interacting with 
# cloud resources

# To push to the Dockerhub repository, we need to authenticate with `docker login`...
# These credentials are used for that.
# Note that this will push images to this repo, so be mindful of that if you have
# separate dockerhub repos for analysis containers that are in production versus
# in development.
# Even though you may not interact with Dockerhub for your local dev environment,
